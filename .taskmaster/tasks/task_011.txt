# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Web Push Notification Capability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to send web push notifications to users who have granted permission.
# Details:
Integrate a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or another push notification service. Implement client-side code to request and handle permissions, and server-side logic to send notifications. Ensure compatibility with different browsers and devices.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the app can request and receive permission for push notifications. Test sending notifications from the server and ensure they are received by clients who have granted permission. Check cross-browser compatibility and handle edge cases like denied permissions or network issues.
