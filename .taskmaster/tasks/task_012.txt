# Task ID: 12
# Title: Add Notification Buttons to Home Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add two buttons on the home page: 'Send Notification' for immediate push notification and 'Send Timed Notification' for delayed notification (30 seconds).
# Details:
Implement two buttons on the home page. The 'Send Notification' button should trigger an immediate web push notification using the existing notification capability. The 'Send Timed Notification' button should delay sending a notification by 30 seconds. Ensure that both buttons are styled consistently with the rest of the UI and handle any potential errors gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that clicking the 'Send Notification' button triggers an immediate push notification. Verify that clicking the 'Send Timed Notification' button triggers a notification after exactly 30 seconds. Test for error handling in cases where notifications cannot be sent, such as permission issues or network problems.
